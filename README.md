# Absurdle

Absurdle is a variation to popular game Wordle. In Wordle, a word is picked at the beginning of the game and you try to guess that target word. However, in Absurdle a specific target word is not chosen at all. With every ensuing guess, Absurdle prunes from the list of potential solutions as little as possible.
